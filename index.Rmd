# Distributions

## Random variables

- A random variable assigns a **real number** to every possible outcome of a random process

- A random variable takes **different values** depending on the outcomes of the random process under study

  **Notation**: We often denote a random variable by an upper case letter, say, $X$, and a particular realized value of $X$ by the corresponding lower case letter, $x$




## Probability

- The probability that $X=x$, denoted $P(X = x)$, is the **proportion of times $X$ take on the value $x$ in many, many independent realizations** of $X$

- For example, consider the random variable $X$ constructed from a coin flip with potential outcomes $\{H,T\}$:

  $$X = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  1 & \text{if } H, \\
  0 & \text{if } T;
  \end{array}
  \right.$$

  
  then, $P(X = 1)$ is the proportion of times that $X=1$ occurred the in many, many coin-flip repetitions


## Distributions

- The **distribution** of a random variable specifies the probability of realizing *each* value of the random variable

- Distinguish b/w **discrete** and **continuous** random variables

## The probability mass function 

- The **probability mass function (PMF)** of a **discrete** random variable $X$ is a function $f_X$ such that

  <div class="box">
  $$f_X(x) = P(X = x); \quad  \sum_x f_X(x) = 1$$
  </div>
  
- The PMF is a list of values taken by the random variable $X$ together with a list of associated probabilities 

## The cumulative distribution function

- The **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** of a discrete random variable $X$ is a function $F_X$ such that

  <div class="box">
  $$F_X(x) = P(X \leq x)$$
  </div>
  
  a **positive**, **increasing** function of $x$ that take on values between 0 and 1
  
## The CDF and PMF of a discrete random variable
  
- When $X$ is a discrete random variable, $F_X$ is the cumulative sum of $f_X$

  <div class="box">
  $$F_X(x) = \sum_{z \leq x} f_X(z)$$
  </div>
  
## The CDF of a continuous random variable

- The CDF of a **continuous** random variable $X$ is defined exactly as for discrete random variables:

  <div class="box">
  $$F_X(x) = P(X \leq x)$$
  </div>
  
  again, a **positive**, **increasing** function that take on values between 0 and 1
  

## The probability density function

- The PMF is unfit for continuous random variables; instead, introduce the **probability density function (PDF)** 

  Like the PMF, the PDF is usually denoted by a lower case letter. So if, $X$ is continuous, the PDF is $f_X(x)$

- The area under the PDF $f_X$ between two points is equal to the probability that $X$ takes a value between those points:

  $$\int_a^{b} f_X(x) dx = F_X(b) - F_X(a);$$
  
  hence, the total area under the PDF $f_X(x)$ is 1.

## The probability density function (cont'd)

- When $X$ is a continuous, $f_X$ is the derivative of $F_X$; 

  equivalently, $F_X$ is the (definite) integral of $f_X$

  <div class="box">
  $$f_X(x) = \frac{d}{dx} F_X(x); \quad F_X(x) = \int^x F_X(z)dz$$
  </div>

# Summary

## Summary

- $P(X = x)$, is the proportion of times $X$ takes the value $x$ in many independent realizations of $X$

- The probabilities with which a discrete random variable takes on different values are given by the PMF

- The probabilities with which a continuous random variable takes on different values are given by the PDF

- The CDF gives the probability that a random variable takes a value less than or equal to a specific value
